## IBrokerResponse.numEntriesScannedPostFilter property

The number of entries scanned after the filtering phase of query execution, ie. aggregation and/or group-by phases. This is equivalent to numDocScanned \* number of projected columns. This along with numEntriesScannedInFilter indicates where most of the time is spent during query processing. A high number for this means the selectivity is low (that is, Pinot needs to scan a lot of records to answer the query). If this is high, consider using star-tree index. (A regular inverted/bitmap index won't improve performance.)

**Signature:**

```typescript
numEntriesScannedPostFilter: number;
```
